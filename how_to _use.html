    <body>

      Time management is a thing that all people have an issue with; that is why we made sure that we do our best to make our customers finish all their to-do lists but at the same enjoy their day without stressing. Customers can connect any smart home hub (Alexa, google nest and apple home) the same way they connect their apple watches (mentioned above) and set a voice notification that can remind them of all things that they have to do. Another way that will help our customers with time management is choosing a schedule template where they do not have to worry about planning their day. You can Download schedule templates by going to "schedules" and pressing on the "+" sign, after you just have to choose the template that suits your life the best. That is how to use LivTo to make sure that you manage your time.
