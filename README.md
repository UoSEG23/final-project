Product Name: LivTo
<br/>
Description:<br/>
Lifestyle app to be used as a scheduling tool. Our original product idea was to develop a portable device that can clean face masks and be compatible with a scheduling app to remind users when to clean their mask. But our team decided to expand our product to an everyday scheduling app and to be more versatile. So this app is a lifestyle app that also includes the feature reminding to clean your mask. The app is user-friendly, convenient, and accessible. Our goal is to have users be control of their schedule and be stress-free.
